# SL Chatbot Team Plugin

A simple Plugin for Streamlabs Chatbot.
You can set your own command in Script Settings in Chatbot. Standard is `!team` and `!setteam`
If you set your command to anything new, the set-command is `!set<command>`.

### Usage:

With `!setteam <user1> <user2>` you can add as many users as you whish.
With `!team` the bot answers with the text you can set in settings and replaces the `$team` with the userlist.
*It's important that you have `$team` in your bot answer*
